Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate model. Here's how it works:
Decision Trees:
Random Forest is composed of multiple decision trees. Each decision tree is built on a subset of the training data and makes decisions based on features that provide the best split to minimize impurity or maximize information gain. Decision trees are prone to overfitting when trained on high-dimensional or noisy data. Random Forest mitigates this by training multiple trees on different subsets of the data and averaging their predictions. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Random Forest employs a technique called bagging. It creates multiple subsets of the training data by sampling with replacement (bootstrap samples). Each decision tree in the Random Forest is trained on one of these bootstrap samples. This randomization introduces diversity among the trees, making them less correlated and improving the model's generalization performance. Random Feature Selection: When splitting nodes in each decision tree, Random Forest considers only a random subset of features**
1.Importing Necessary Libraries:
The code imports essential libraries for machine learning tasks: pandas for data manipulation and analysis. train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection to split the dataset into training and testing sets. RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble for building a random forest classifier model. accuracy_score, precision_score, and f1_score from sklearn.metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset: The code loads the dataset from the specified URL using pd.read_csv(). It assumes that the target variable is named 'target' and separates it from the features. The features are stored in X, and the target variable is stored in y.
2.Splitting the Data:
The code uses train_test_split() to split the dataset into training and testing sets. It allocates 60% of the data for training (X_train, y_train) and 40% for testing (X_test, y_test). test_size=0.4 indicates that 40% of the data will be used for testing, and random_state=42 ensures reproducibility of the split.
3.Training Random Forest Classifier:
It initializes a RandomForestClassifier object with 100 decision trees (n_estimators=100) and sets random_state=42 for reproducibility. The model is trained on the training data (X_train, y_train) using the fit() method.
4.Evaluation and Printing Metrics:
The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data (X_test).
5.The code calculates three evaluation metrics:
 - Accuracy (rf_accuracy): Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.
 - Precision (rf_precision): Indicates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. 
 - F1 Score (rf_f1): Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between them.
Finally, the code prints out the evaluated metrics
